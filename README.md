## Overview


The focus of this assignment was to work in a collaborative development project with a group of fellow students to create a website that met the following criteria:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts.
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

**The group chose to create an interactive, instant celebrity fan site creator.**

## Description

The idea of this website is to utilize multiple third party APIs to create an instant, interactive movie star fan website. When the user connects, they are asked to enter a movie star's name.  After entering, the user is transported to an automatically generated fan site for that celebrity, that can be further customized by the user.  Increased customization includes:

<br/>

* Professional head shot of the movie star
* "Known for" movie information boxes that include:
    * Thumbnail movie poster
    * Movie's title
    * Movie's release date
    * Movie's user rating score (out of 10)
    * A plot synopsis 
* Favorite movie list
* Background color picker
* "Generate GIF" button that randomly displays an animated GIF of that movie star.
* A "start over" button that lets the user pick a new celebrity.

## Review of Tasks


* Divided the team into two teams: **back end** and **front end**.
* Delegated duties amongst teams utlitizing the project kanban.
* Built API queries
* Selected Bulma CSS framework & built UI 
* Set up local storage variables to hold favorite movies list, celebrity name, and the response object from the APIs.
* Displayed response data into front end UI
* Masno & Ellen wrote the GIPHY GIF generation
* Doug wrote the "enter" event listener
* Malik wrote the "start over" feature
* Troy wrote the background color picker
* Jacob wrote the favorite movie list back end



#### Here are the steps taken to achieve this complete our project:

* Built initial file system structure and deployed basic blueprint to Github to complete repository construction.
* Sketched out pseudo code logic and transcribed them into the code as comments.
* Utilizing the kanban, tasks were delegated over the weeks to various members.  
* Learned the "Git Collaborative Experience" through constant communication, updates & working out merge conflicts with team members.
* Practiced presentation multiple times Thursday.

After multiple trial and error debugging sessions, all applied logic appears sound and no bugs can be generated from purposeful negligent entries.  From this point, it was time to clean up:

* Refactor reduntant and worthless code.
* Removed multiple, annoying console.log commands used for debugging.
* Double-checked to ensured code was properly formatted and commented before submission.
* Used code validation service.
* Wrote README.MD file.
* Added screenshots to README.

### Installation

Installation should be fairly straightforward, but here's a quick guide to get up and running, assuming you have **Visual Studio Code** and **Git** (with the accompanying interface **Git Bash**) installed.

* from your shell input the command: `git clone https://github.com/kvadou/Pinegroove`
* once downloaded, from the working directory in the shell, input the command: `code .`

### Live Example

This project can be previewed live via Github Pages at: https://kvadou.github.io/Pinegroove/
