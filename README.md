## Overview


The focus of this assignment was to work in a collaborative development project with a group of fellow students to create a website that met the following criteria:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

**The group chose to create an interactive, instant celebrity fan site creator.**

## Description

The idea of this website is to utilize multiple third party APIs to create an instant, interactive celebrity fan website. When the user connects, they are asked to enter a celebrity.  After entering, the user is transported to an automatically generated fan site for that celebrity, that can be further customized by the user.  Increased customization includes:

<br/>

* Favorite Movie Poster
* Favorite Quote
* Favorite Movie List

## Review of Tasks


* Divided the team into two teams: **back end** and **front end**.
* Delegated duties amongst teams.
* 


#### Here are the steps taken to achieve this complete our project:

* Built initial file system structure and deployed basic blueprint to Github to complete repository construction.
* Sketched out pseudo code logic and transcribed them into the code as comments.



After multiple trial and error debugging sessions, all applied logic appears sound and no bugs can be generated from purposeful negligent entries.  From this point, it was time to clean up:

* Refactor reduntant and worthless code.
* Removed multiple, annoying console.log commands used for debugging.
* Double-checked to ensured code was properly formatted and commented before submission.
* Used code validation service.
* Wrote README.MD file.
* Added screenshots to README.

### Installation

Installation should be fairly straightforward, but here's a quick guide to get up and running, assuming you have **Visual Studio Code** and **Git** (with the accompanying interface **Git Bash**) installed.

* from your shell input the command: `git clone https://github.com/kvadou/Pinegroove`
* once downloaded, from the working directory in the shell, input the command: `code .`

### Live Example
